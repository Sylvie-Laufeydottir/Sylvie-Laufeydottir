A few years ago, I realized that I wanted to focus my efforts on improving the observability and cloud-native areas. For this reason, I'm trying to make more and more contributions to open source projects like opentelemetry, jaeger, terraform, etc.

#### ðŸ§¡ &nbsp;&nbsp;My passions

* distributed database, systems
* observability, monitoring system
* nature and sunshine
